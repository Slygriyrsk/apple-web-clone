### Navbar Component

Here's a simple example of a responsive Navbar using Tailwind CSS:

  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';

  const Navbar = () => {
    return (
      <nav className="bg-gray-900 text-white p-4">
        <div className="container mx-auto flex justify-between items-center">
          <a href="#" className="text-2xl font-bold">Apple Clone</a>
          <ul className="flex space-x-4">
            <li><a href="#hero" className="hover:underline">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#features" className="hover:underline">Features</a></li>

      gsap.from(".hero-title", { duration: 2, opacity: 0, y: -50 });
    }, []);

    return (
      <section className="hero bg-blue-500 text-white h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
